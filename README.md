# Introduction

This boilerplate is targeted towards large, serious projects and assumes you are somewhat familiar with Webpack and `weex-loader`. 

## Quickstart

``` bash

cd weex-app-demo
npm install
npm start

```

## 打包或者运行原生app

```bash

weex run android

```


## How to use less/sass/pug

Take `sass` for example:

```
$ npm i node-sass sass-loader --save
```

Then, you just need to change the `style` tag as: `<style lang="sass"><style>`.
